The plugin is provided "as is" and the user assumes full responsibility for configuring and using it appropriately for their specific needs.

Maspik is GDPR compliant.

1. **Install the plugin**
   * In your WordPress dashboard, go to **Plugins → Add New**
   * Search for **"Maspik"**
   * Click **Install Now**, then **Activate**

2. **Basic Setup**

   * Save changes

3. **Advanced Configuration (Optional)**
   * Add custom blacklist phrases and patterns

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the setup process like? =

Installation takes just a couple of minutes:  
Search for "Maspik" in your WordPress plugins section, click **Install**, and activate.

The plugin comes with smart pre-configured protection that works immediately. You can start blocking spam right away, without any technical configuration.  
If you need more advanced settings, please see the [documentation](https://wpmaspik.com/documentation/getting-started/?readme-file).

= How effective is Maspik at blocking spam? =

Maspik uses multiple detection methods including smart pattern recognition, honeypot fields, advanced key checks, and blacklist systems to achieve a 95%+ success rate in blocking spam.

Unlike traditional CAPTCHA solutions, Maspik works silently in the background and does not disrupt your real users.

= What is the AI spam check? =

By default, the AI Spam Check feature is disabled in Maspik.

When enabled, it analyzes each form submission using leading AI models — Google Gemini, OpenAI, and Mistral AI — to estimate how likely the message is to be spam.

The AI decision is not 100% perfect.  
To make the system stricter or more permissive, you can:

* Adjust the spam threshold
* Add custom context to help the AI understand your intent

For example, you can add context like:

* "Be very strict with any message that sounds like a sales pitch."
* "Accept only messages written in English."
* "Treat repeated keywords or links as spam."

You can configure AI spam check in the **Maspik → AI Spam Check** settings page.

= Will Maspik affect my site's performance? =

No. Maspik is designed for optimal performance, using primarily server-side processing.  
All spam checking is done efficiently and does not significantly affect your front-end page load times.

= What customization options are available? =

You can customize:

* Text blacklists
* Email patterns
* Character limits
* Link restrictions
* IP blocking rules
* Phone number patterns
* Country-based filtering (Pro)
* Language-based filtering (Pro)

Each field type can have its own specific settings, allowing you to create the perfect balance between strictness and usability.

= Does Maspik protect all types of forms? =

Yes. Maspik protects:

* Contact forms
* Comments
* Registration forms
* Custom PHP forms
* Some WooCommerce flows (with Pro)

It currently supports:

* Elementor Forms
* Contact Form 7
* Hello Plus
* Ninja Forms
* Everest Forms
* Formidable Forms
* JetFormBuilder
* Forminator Forms
* Fluent Forms
* Bricks Builder Forms
* Breakdance Builder Forms
* BuddyPress
* Bitforms
* Metform
* Custom PHP forms
* WPForms (Maspik Pro license required)
* Gravity Forms (Maspik Pro license required)
* WordPress comments
* WordPress registration form
* WooCommerce registration form (Maspik Pro license required)
* WooCommerce review (Maspik Pro license required)
* WooCommerce orders (Maspik Pro license required)

More forms will be supported in future releases.  
Looking for specific plugin support? Let us know at [wpmaspik.com](https://wpmaspik.com/#contact).

= How does the spam logging system work? =

Maspik includes a detailed spam log that shows:

* Which submissions were blocked
* Why they were blocked
* Which rules were triggered

This helps you fine-tune settings, understand spam patterns, and improve protection without losing real leads.

= How can I block spam in WordPress using Maspik? =

With Maspik, you can effectively block:

* Spam submissions
* Spam comments
* Spam bots
* Spam registrations

Maspik acts as a spam filter and spam blocker, helping you stop unwanted content, spam users, and automated attacks — without using CAPTCHA.

Simply:

1. Install and activate Maspik
2. Go through the settings page
3. Enable the features that match your needs

The plugin then runs silently in the background and protects your forms.

= Does the plugin work with all WordPress forms? =

Maspik protects contact forms, comments, registration forms, and more.

Currently supported forms include (see full list above). If your form plugin is not listed, you can often still integrate it using the **custom PHP forms** filter documented here:  
https://wpmaspik.com/documentation/custom-php-form/?readme-file

= How can I report security bugs? =

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program.  
The Patchstack team helps validate, triage, and handle any security vulnerabilities.

[Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/contact-forms-anti-spam)

= How does Maspik compare to other anti-spam plugins? =

Plugins like Akismet or CleanTalk require external API configuration, monthly subscriptions, and can be complex to set up.

Maspik offers a self-hosted solution that:

* Works out of the box
* Runs most checks inside WordPress
* Has no mandatory external dependencies
* Has no required recurring fees for core spam protection

Antispam Bee is a great plugin but is focused mainly on comments and has a more limited feature set.

If you need advanced spam protection that:

* Works with all your forms
* Provides detailed logs and statistics
* Offers advanced controls (AI, IP, blacklist, country/language in Pro)

Then Maspik is an excellent choice for your WordPress spam protection.
